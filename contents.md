 - "Week 8" implements a ReLU neural net using only numpy, explaining how to initialize weights, and visualizing them in order to emphasize that they are, simply, CPwL's.
 - "Week 9" implements gradient descent using only numpy
 - "Week 10" gives an introduction to pytorch
 - "Week 11" demonstrates `torch.autograd`
 - "Week 12" fits a neural net to MNIST.
